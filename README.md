A side project.

It is a GUI that currently shows simple chords/scales for a 4-string bass guitar on an interactive fretboard.

The project is currently (01/03/2020) dormant.  It is in the middle of transitioning away from RDB to json files.  Only chords and scales have made the transition (licks and jam progressions are yet to transition).

You will need to install JavaFX to run this code.

to install JavaFX in Eclipse:
1)	Go to help menu -> install new software…
2)	Top right of the window click on “add”
3)	Name is not important, but I call it “oxygen”
4)	Location is http://download.eclipse.org/releases/oxygen/
5)	Select this new repository from the drop down menu in the “install new software” window
6)	Expand “general purpose tools”
7)	Select "e(fx)lipse" (or something similar...I'm working from memory here :) )
8)	Press “next” and follow instructions to install
